# ProblemsOnArray
It contains some interesting questions for a DSA beginner in java:)
The questions are:
1. Given an integer m, n, and n integers, return true if the number of unique integers among the n integers is greater than or equal to m, else return false.(Integers appearing multiple times are all considered as 1 unique integer)
2. Given an integer array arr, return the number of consecutive sequences(subarrays) with odd sum.
3. You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]). Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
